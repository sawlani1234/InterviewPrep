1. single leader replication  only
2. eventually consistency guarantes with HA replica
3. you can choose to have replica or only single node
4. for more druability add WAIT 
5. lua script for exeucuting multiple statmeents atomically
   -- redis.Script(script,args....)
6. single instance lock 
  -- but need have different values so to avoid accidental lock
7. add redlock for locking for distributed
  -- lock with quorum  , still not full proof though
