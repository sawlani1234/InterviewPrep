Notes about design missing part 

1. Use state machine like temporal to have matching  , it will make system simpler to move states rather than having web sockets 
for all 
2. as it is adaptive location updates its fine to have httt api call 
3. we also have notitfication service to send notification to drivers through APN , FCM (they are not classical SSE)
4. we have scaling through geohashing  
5. one driver can have only request at a time
